<h1>Mark Zuckerberg Email Leak:<br>Rigged Facebook for Trump in 2016 at Request of Putin</h1>
<h5>April 3, 2018</h5>
<h3>The following email chain was uploaded to Wikileaks by an anonymous software engineer at Google (subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.) who vehemently opposes American President Donald Trump, and felt a moral obligation to expose the illegal actions that led to his election. This engineer stated to Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks that "Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Thiel must be jailed for violating campaign finance law for an in kind contribution (election assistance), and being unregistered foreign agents, additionally they should be forever viewed by the American public as traitors for undermining our election to support a murderous autocrat who regularly suppresses speech, marriage equality and democracy."</h3>
